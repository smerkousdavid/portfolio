# Davids Site

This is the repository containing the static site generated for [https://smerkous.com](https://smerkous.com).

The main frameworks used are Hugo + React. I use Hugo for the static page generation of the markdown files used for the blog posts. Then I use react for interactive components, either through the shortcodes, or the entire home page is built via React. Note the home page is located in the `landing` folder.

## Screenshot
This is what the site looks like with the react landing page of the solar system.
